# I am aware of
1. Instead of using a bunch of if statements I could of instead used a else if or even a switch case.
2. I could of used a function whenever getting the x and y values from inputs.

In the end, all of this doesn't matter as this was just a project to get to know Rust better. I may however fix all of these in the future, but likely not today from when this is being written and likely not tomorrow from when this is being written.
